# As the model mistralai/Mistral-7B-v0.1 is restricted. You must be authenticated to access it. You need to add HuggingFace token
1. Go to *Hugging Face* and log into your account.
2. Navigate to the Settings tab and select Access Tokens.
3. Click New Token. Assign it the necessary scopesâ€”usually, "read" is sufficient for downloading models.
4. Save this token somewhere secure.
5. Use this token in your notebook:
   ```
   import os
   
   # Set the token as an environment variable
    os.environ["HF_TOKEN"] = "your_token_here"
6. Or you can also explicitly pass the token to the *from_pretrained* method:
   ```
   tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name, use_auth_token="your_token_here")
